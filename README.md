Yuval &amp; Almog Printer Manager System , Final Project for Software Enginerring <br>

## Project title : PrinterApplication
### this project covers the rest API service 
## Prject title : virtualPrinterV_1
### this project covers the client that can work with the service 

## build Status
 no problem so far <br>
## Code style
java language , <br>
names in Camel Casing  <br>

## Installation
the proper way the install the project is : <br>

## Screenshots
after inital build , if done correctly should be able to run the apllications like so :![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120096334/221821299-1767ddaf-4703-46c4-9208-56e68d0a94ba.png)
we suggest first to open the server and then the client but both options are vaild.<br>
if initSomeData is not removed from the code you will have some printer inside the server already that we defined .<br>

there are 5 printers in total and 2 jobs inside printer number 1 and number 5 <br>
after running the virtual printer you should get this inside the console :

option 1 is to enter printer id and that printer will print a job (if the printer got a job to print)
option 2 is to send a random request to print , the server will try to look for a printer with a job and print (the printer id is randomised from the printer list and will try 10 times before giving up ) 
option 3 is to stop the virtual printer from running .
example of using the virtual printer with the server : <br>

## Tech/Framework used
Rest API , <br>
rabbitMQ, <br>

## API reference
we are using local host portal 8080 for the server <br>

## How To Use
before you can start sending msg to the server it's imoratnt do define the queue <br>

we explained how to use the client in previous part , so we will foucs on how to use the server,<br>
the server currently got 12 valid enpoints that can be used as follow : <br>

 we recommand using postman to send those endpoints <br>
 in the intial server we added 5 printer to play with, printer 1 and printer 5 got a job to print .
